**My name is Juho Pekkala**. I was born in the Arctic Circle in a town called Rovaniemi, Finland. Rovaniemi is also called The Capital of Lapland. It's famous for nightless nights during the summer, the hometown of Santa Claus and the Northern Lights after the summer when the darkness once again descends.

From a young age, I was interested in computers. I have had the privilege to have a computer at home since childhood. After starting gaming in the nineties with the 8-bit Nintendo, the desktop computer provided a new kind of world with its 3D games and other possibilities. In high school, I had to choose between my interests and what kind of career I want to pursue. I was interested in carpeting, architecture and computers and these were the options where I'd choose from. I loved woodworking, also I was a fan of Alvar Aalto and drew floor plans and designs in my free time, but also I spent a lot of time with computers by myself or with my friends. Eventually, my choice was to pursue computer science studies and move to Oulu. I thought the computers and internet will be the future thing, and apparently, I wasn't wrong.

I'm yet to discover what sort of a blog this will but I'd like to think it leaning towards a tech-oriented blog with a touch of personal life such as hobbies and interests. Besides tech, I love creativity, especially photography, exploring nature with my dog Sylvi and adventures of any sort, metal music, and sports in various ways but especially gym is my number one favourite!

I have long thought about writing a series of software development-related topics. Writing specific technical or how-to tutorials tends to get old quickly. Instead, I would like to write about mindsets, phenomenons and software development processes overall that tend to last longer and it will be nice later to return to old thoughts and the spirit of the time.

Writing about various topics or creating a series of blogs has also an educational effect, an idea I like. Reading and learning once, putting it into practice and even teaching and writing about it will give the repetitive effect and enhance the learning. I hope this will help push me to the next level professionally by improving my confidence and competence, and in the meantime might be useful to others in the same position.
